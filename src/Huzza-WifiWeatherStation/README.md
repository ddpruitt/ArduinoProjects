# Adafruit Weather Station

In this project, we'll learn how to make a DIY fully featured weather station using an ESP8266 and a 2.4" TFT touchscreen display. This project pulls weather data using the Wunderground API. It displays the date, time, current weather conditionals, 4-day forecast and even moon phases.
